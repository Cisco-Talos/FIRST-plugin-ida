View Metadata History
=====================
The history for metadata can be viewed in several different places.
- A match in a Query FIRST operation (Check Function or Check All Functions dialog box)
- The management and currently applied view of the main FIRST plugin window
- A function with FIRST metadata applied from the IDA View window via the right click menu

The Check Function/Check All Functions dialog boxes and Currently Applied/Management views use a tree structure to display function annotations. Right click anywhere within the record for an annotation to open the popup menu. In this menu select the **View History** operation and a new dialog box will open up displaying the revisions made to the annotations by the original author.

When annotations from FIRST are applied to a function, a new right click menu option becomes available. The **View metadata history** operation will open a dialog box with the revision history.
